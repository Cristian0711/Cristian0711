# 💫 About Me:

🚀 **I'm currently working on:** Advanced automation systems and security-focused applications. My primary project is mNb, a sophisticated in-memory worker for game automation that replicates human-like behavior, currently serving over 400 users as a commercial product.

🛠️ **Specialized in:** Low-level programming, memory manipulation, reverse engineering, and building secure applications with an emphasis on performance.

🤝 **I'm looking to collaborate on:** Any software development applications, but I particularly enjoy working on projects related to reverse engineering and software security. I thrive on tackling challenging technical problems that require deep system knowledge and am open to any software development opportunities.  

🌱 **I'm currently learning:** Enhancing my skills in web application security, kernel development, networking, application designs, and expanding my knowledge of encryption protocols for secure communications.

💬 **Ask me about:**
- Reverse engineering and binary analysis
- Memory manipulation techniques and hooking
- Process injection methods
- Secure peer-to-peer communications
- Web application development with security focus

🎓 **Education:** Bachelor's Degree in Economic Informatics from Bucharest University of Economic Studies (Expected June 2025)
